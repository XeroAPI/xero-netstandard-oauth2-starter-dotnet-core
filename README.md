# Xero NetStandard OAuth 2.0 Starter App
This is a starter app build with .NET Core 3.1 MVC to demonstrate Xero OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication & OAuth 2.0 APIs. 

![NetStandardDemo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41350731/76293982-27636380-6306-11ea-8b83-e4dda46b7365.gif)

__IMPORTANT!__ This application is for demo only. We recommend setting up a secure token storage for your production usage.

Its functions include:

- connect & reconnect to xero
- storing Xero token in a .json file
- refresh Xero access token on expiry
- read organisation information from /organisation endpoint
- read contacts information from /contacts endpoint
- create a new contact in Xero

You can connect this starter app to an actual Xero organisation and make real API calls. Please use your Demo Company organisation for your testing. [Here](https://central.xero.com/s/article/Use-the-demo-company) is how to turn it on. 

### Create a Xero app
You will need your Xero app credentials created to run this demo app. 
To obtain your API keys, follow these steps:

* Create a [free Xero user account](https://www.xero.com/us/signup/api/) (if you don't have one)
* Login to [Xero developer center](https://developer.xero.com/myapps)
* Click "New App" link
* Enter your App name, company url, privacy policy url.
* Enter the redirect URI (your callback url - i.e. `https://localhost:5001/Authorization/Callback`)
* Agree to terms and condition and click "Create App".
* Click "Generate a secret" button.
* Copy your client id and client secret and save for use later.
* Click the "Save" button. You secret is now hidden.

### Download the code
Clone this repo to your local drive or open with GitHub desktop client.

### Configure your API Keys
In /NetStandardApp/appsettings.json, you should populate your XeroConfiguration as such: 

```
  "XeroConfiguration": {
    "ClientId": "YOUR_XERO_APP_CLIENT_ID",
    "ClientSecret": "YOUR_XERO_APP_CLIENT_SECRET",
    "CallbackUri": "https://localhost:5001/Authorization/Callback",
    "Scope": "openid offline_access profile ... ",
    "State": "YOUR_STATE"
  }
```

Note that you will have to have a state. The CallbackUri has to be exactly the same as redirect URI you put in Xero developer portal letter by letter.

## Some explanation of the code

There are three controllers in this MVC app:

**HomeController**
- checks if there is a xerotoken.json, and 
- passes a boolean firstTimeConnection to view to control the display of buttons. 

**AuthorizationController**
- reads XeroConfiguration &  make httpClientFactory available via dependency injection
- on /Authorization/, redirects user to Xero OAuth for authentication & authorization
- receives callback on /Authorization/Callback request Xero token
- get connected tenants (organisations) 
- store token via a static method TokenUtilities.StoreToken(xeroToken);

**OrganisationInfoController**
- gets or refreshes stored token
- make api call to organisation endpoint 
- displays in view

**ContactInfoController** 
- gets or refreshes stored token 
- make api call to contacts endpoint
- displays in view
- static view Create.cshtml creates a webform and POST contact info to Create() action, and
- makes an create operation to contacts endpoint 

Xero token is stored in a JSON file in the root of the project "./xerotoken.json". The app serialise and deserialise with the static class functions in /Utilities/TokenUtilities.cs.
